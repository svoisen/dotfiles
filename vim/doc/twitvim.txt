==============================================================================
2. Introduction						*TwitVim-intro*

TwitVim is a plugin that allows you to post to Twitter, a microblogging
service at http://www.twitter.com.


==============================================================================
3. Installation						*TwitVim-install*

	1. Install cURL.				*TwitVim-cURL*

	If you don't already have cURL on your system, download it from
	http://curl.haxx.se/. Make sure that the curl executable is in a
	directory listed in your PATH environment variable, or the equivalent
	for your system.


	2. twitvim.vim					*TwitVim-add*

	Add twitvim.vim to your plugins directory. The location depends on
	your operating system. See |add-global-plugin| for details.

	If you installed from the Vimball (.vba) file, twitvim.vim should
	already be in its correct place.


	3. twitvim_login				*twitvim_login*

	Add the following to your vimrc:

		let twitvim_login = "USER:PASS"

	Replace USER with your Twitter user name and PASS with your Twitter
	password.

	It is possible to avoid having your Twitter password in plaintext in
	your vimrc. See |TwitVim-login-base64| for details.


	4. twitvim_proxy				*twitvim_proxy*

	This step is only needed if you access the web through a HTTP proxy.
	If you use a HTTP proxy, add the following to your vimrc:

		let twitvim_proxy = "proxyserver:proxyport"

	Replace proxyserver with the address of the HTTP proxy and proxyport
	with the port number of the HTTP proxy.


	5. twitvim_proxy_login				*twitvim_proxy_login*

	If the HTTP proxy requires authentication, add the following to your
	vimrc:

		let twitvim_proxy_login = "proxyuser:proxypassword"

	Where proxyuser is your proxy user and proxypassword is your proxy
	password.

	It is possible to avoid having your proxy password in plaintext in
	your vimrc. See |TwitVim-login-base64| for details.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Base64-Encoded Login				*TwitVim-login-base64*

	For safety purposes, TwitVim allows you to specify your Twitter login
	and proxy login information preencoded in base64. This is not truly
	secure as it is not encryption but it can stop casual onlookers
	from reading off your password when you edit your vimrc.

						*twitvim_login_b64*
	To do that, set the following in your vimrc:

		let twitvim_login_b64 = "base64string"
	
						*twitvim_proxy_login_b64*
	If your HTTP proxy needs authentication, set the following:

		let twitvim_proxy_login_b64 = "base64string"


	Where base64string is your username:password encoded in base64.


	An example:

	Let's say Joe User has a Twitter login of "joeuser" and a password of
	"joepassword". His first step is to encode "joeuser:joepassword" in
	Base64. He can either use a standalone utility to do that or, in a
	pinch, he can do the encoding at websites such as the following:
	http://makcoder.sourceforge.net/demo/base64.php
	http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/Base64Encode/

	The result is: am9ldXNlcjpqb2VwYXNzd29yZA==

	Then he adds the following to his vimrc:

		let twitvim_login_b64 = "am9ldXNlcjpqb2VwYXNzd29yZA=="

	And his setup is ready.


==============================================================================
4. TwitVim Manual					*TwitVim-manual*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Update Commands				*TwitVim-update-commands*

	These commands post an update to your Twitter account. If the friends,
	user, or public timeline is visible, TwitVim will insert the update
	into the timeline view after posting it.

	:PosttoTwitter					*:PosttoTwitter*

	This command will prompt you for a message and post it to Twitter.

	:CPosttoTwitter					*:CPosttoTwitter*

	This command posts the current line in the current buffer to Twitter.

	:BPosttoTwitter					*:BPosttoTwitter*

	This command posts the contents of the current buffer to Twitter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Timeline Commands				*TwitVim-timeline-commands*

	These commands retrieve a Twitter timeline and display it in a special
	Twitter buffer. TwitVim applies syntax highlighting to highlight
	certain elements in the timeline view. See |TwitVim-highlight| for a
	list of highlighting groups it uses.


	:[count]UserTwitter				*:UserTwitter*
	:[count]UserTwitter {username}

	This command displays your Twitter timeline.

	If you specify a {username}, this command displays the timeline for
	that user.

	If you specify [count], that number is used as the page number. For
	example, :2UserTwitter displays the second page from your user
	timeline.


	:[count]FriendsTwitter				*:FriendsTwitter*
	:[count]FriendsTwitter {username}

	This command displays your Twitter timeline with updates from friends
	merged in.

	If you specify a {username}, this command displays the friends
	timeline for that user.

	If you specify [count], that number is used as the page number. For
	example, :2FriendsTwitter displays the second page from your friends
	timeline.


	:[count]RepliesTwitter				*:RepliesTwitter*

	This command displays a timeline of @-replies that you've received
	from other Twitter users.

	If you specify [count], that number is used as the page number. For
	example, :2RepliesTwitter displays the second page from your replies
	timeline.


	:PublicTwitter					*:PublicTwitter*

	This command displays the public timeline.


	:[count]DMTwitter				*:DMTwitter*

	This command displays direct messages that you've received.

	If you specify [count], that number is used as the page number. For
	example, :2DMTwitter displays the second page from your direct
	messages timeline.


	:[count]DMSentTwitter				*:DMSentTwitter*

	This command displays direct messages that you've sent.

	If you specify [count], that number is used as the page number. For
	example, :2DMSentTwitter displays the second page from your direct
	messages sent timeline.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3. Mappings						*TwitVim-mappings*

	Alt-T						*TwitVim-A-t*

	In visual mode, Alt-T posts the highlighted text to Twitter.

	Ctrl-T						*TwitVim-C-t*

	This is an alternative to the Alt-T mapping. If the menu bar is
	enabled, Alt-T pulls down the Tools menu. So use this mapping instead.

	Alt-R						*TwitVim-A-r*
	<Leader>r					*TwitVim-Leader-r*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. In the timeline buffer,
	it starts composing an @-reply on the command line to the author of
	the tweet on the current line.

	Under Cygwin, Alt-R is not recognized so you can use <Leader>r as an
	alternative. The <Leader> character defaults to \ (backslash) but see
	|mapleader| for information on customizing that.

	Alt-D						*TwitVim-A-d*
	<Leader>d					*TwitVim-Leader-d*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. In the timeline buffer,
	it starts composing a direct message on the command line to the author
	of the tweet on the current line.

	Under Cygwin, Alt-D is not recognized so you can use <Leader>d as an
	alternative. The <Leader> character defaults to \ (backslash) but see
	|mapleader| for information on customizing that.

	Alt-G						*TwitVim-A-g*
	<Leader>g					*TwitVim-Leader-g*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. It launches the web
	browser with the URL at the cursor position. If you visually select
	text before invoking this mapping, it launches the web browser with
	the selected text.

	As a special case, if the cursor is on a word of the form @user or
	user:, TwitVim will display that user's timeline in the timeline
	buffer. This will not launch the web browser.

							*twitvim_browser_cmd*
	Before using this command, you need to tell TwitVim how to launch your
	browser. For example, you can add the following to your vimrc:

		let twitvim_browser_cmd = 'firefox.exe'

	Of course, replace firefox.exe with the browser of your choice.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. TwitVim Credits					*TwitVim-credits*

	Thanks to Travis Jeffery, the author of the original VimTwitter script
	(vimscript #2124), who came up with the idea of running cURL from Vim
	to access the Twitter API.

	Techniques for managing the Twitter buffer were adapted from the NERD
	Tree plugin (vimscript #1658) by Marty Grenfell.
